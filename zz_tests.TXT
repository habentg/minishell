1. env > $Q
segfault coz I am removing the file (VAR) if its not env
    -> Fixed!
2.  cat < ./test_files/infile_big < readleak.txt (working as expected)
        VS
    cat < ./test_files/infile_big readleak.txt  (CMD_NOT_FOUND, taking readleak.txt as cmd)
    -> fixed!
3. SIGNAL SIGNAL SIGNAL for fucks sake!
    -> not yet!
4. Redirection and file
     -> Fixed ==> alot of them
5. exit "" -> as of now, I am removing empty tokens so this will be considered just exit
            however bash takes it as a NULL, non numeric value so the exit status is 255
    -> Yet to be fixed.
